# System Engineer :computer:

As a highly skilled and experienced system developer with over 8 years of experience in a variety of programming languages, including `JavaScript`, `C++`, `C`, `Python`, `Ruby`, and `PHP`, I am capable of tackling even the most complex projects with ease. I am also proficient in `web design` and have a keen eye for aesthetics, allowing me to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

matter of fact :

    const Maybe = value => ({
      map: fn => (value === null ? Maybe(null) : Maybe(fn(value))),
      get: () => value
    });

In my spare time, I indulge my passions for anime, music, and philosophy, always seeking new ways to expand my knowledge and understanding of these subjects. I am a true polymath and enjoy sharing my interests and expertise with others. :nerd_face:
